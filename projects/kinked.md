Kinked explores different people's relationship towards kink, intimacy and sexuality across various key stages of life.
Kinked will cast light on stories, bodies and voices often kept in the shadows of popular culture, the ambition being to open dialogues and perspectives around pathologised subjects and the larger cultural narratives surrounding them.
