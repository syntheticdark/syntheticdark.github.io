Shot on location in India and Pakistan, Into Dust tells the extraordinary true story of Perween Rahman, a woman who worked tirelessly to protect the rights of Pakistan’s poor, and paid the ultimate price. Set against the backdrop of a global water crisis, Perween’s story highlights the dangers of what can happen as our water starts to run out.
