[Design]()


The client for Reflex was a young couple who had recently moved house and wanted to dispense with the disposable furniture of their previous property. Something to last, and something that was both modern in aesthetic and traditional in choices of material. The combination of gunblackened steel and Sapele provides a striking resonance.

The project started with several cardboard mock-ups at different scales. The final model at 1:1 scale gave a real sense of how the finished item would fit in the room.

Wood was sourced from [Moss & Co](https://www.mosstimber.co.uk/) and was delivered to spec. The construction involved firstly CADing the design, then water-jet cutting the 3mm steel and TIG welding the sheets to form the three dimensional legs. Once the metal was complete, slots were routed into the then lacquered Sapele to allow assembly.
