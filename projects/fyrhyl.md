[Design]()


A design project for a bedside table that would hold more than the traditional two shelf bedside table while also being more beautiful. It also had to be floor standing and  have a high shelf for trailing plants.

Drawn and then CADed in Autodesk Fusion, the first designs show the distinctive shelves, although more than there would eventually be.

Ash was taken from raw lumber, thicknessed, ripped and then cut to length. The assembly involved gluing with wooden dowels which provides support for the shelves.

One of the shelves was left with a semi-natural finish, with residuals of the bark left to show the natural roots of the raw materials.
